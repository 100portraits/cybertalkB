              <p class="short-desc">We are a group of students from the University of Amsterdam in the first year of Computational Social Science course. As part of this interdisciplinary programme, we collaborate with different organizations and institutions in the Netherlands and worldwide to solve societal issues using technology. For the past four months, we have worked together on a project regarding the <span style="font-weight: bold;">inclusion of ICT in the classroom </span>to enhance both the teaching and learning experiences for educators and students. 

                <br><br>
                We chose to investigate the following research question: 
                <br>
                <br>

                <span style="font-weight: bold;">

                    How can teachers be encouraged to implement digital teaching techniques in the classroom?

            <p>The research was formed in collaboration with our project partner - <b style="font-weight: bold;">HackShield Future Cyber Heroes</b>. They have developed an educational game for children to learn about cybersecurity and introduced us to the topic of gamification in education. <br><br>This led us to studying the use of innovative digital teaching techniques by teachers and other educators. So far, we have conducted a stakeholder analysis, a literature review, a focus group with teachers and educational experts, and A/B testing.

            <p>By creating this website, we would like to get the interest of teachers, school administrators, or anyone in the education system who wants to learn more about innovative educational methods and is looking for ideas and digital tools to implement in their classes. We hope that our intervention (this website)  will not only help teachers around the world to make their classes more engaging, but also initiate the needed change in the educational system to be more on pace with the on-going technological development.</p>

        <div class="p3">
            <p><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Which tools did we choose?</span>
<br><br>
                We have conducted an extensive research on what digital platforms are the most popular and the most liked among teachers. We used academic and non-academic sources, like research papers or online rankings, as a baseline for our suggestions. Also, we asked our current teachers and drew from our own experiences, including even more tools and categories to the website. Nevertheless, the tools choice will be in ongoing development as we introduced a rating system for the users to express their opinions on certain platforms and thus, verify their effectiveness. That way, our website will present only user- and privacy-friendly products which have a wide appeal and confirmed benefits.

<!--<br><br>It is recognized that the level of the students' engagement in the classroom has a significant part of their education as it improves their academic performance. The research has shown that the teacher has influence on students' motivation through factors such as their teaching methods and content. An engaged teacher usually searches for new ideas, accommodates material to their students' needs, monitors their progress, etc. It is recommended that the educator uses an Engagement measurement/reflection tool.-->
